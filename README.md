# RiskGame

This repo implements the [Risk Board Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_%28game%29).  It has GUI for interacting with the user. This was implemented as a part of our college assignment.

It also contains a AI bot which can be used to play with the user. NOTE: The AI is not attached to the RiskGame app yet.

## Requirements

To run the game you need
1. Java JDK 1.8+
2. Netbeans IDE 8.1+
